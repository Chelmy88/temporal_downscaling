## Introduction
This repository contains the source code of the analysis presented in the paper:
Climate change scenarios at hourly time-step over Switzerland from an enhanced
temporal downscaling approach, published in the International
Journal of Climatology.

This code can be used to perform temporal downscaling of meteorological time
series from daily to hourly timesteps and to perform the quality assessment
described in the paper.

## Code provided
The code to perform the temporal downscaling is provided in the directory
'1_downscaling', and the code to perform the assessment is provided in the
directory '2_assessment'. READMEs with usage instructions are provided in
these directories.

## Data provided
The dataset described in the paper are available at:
